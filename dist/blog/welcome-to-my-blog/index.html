I just wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you in case this is the first time that you visit this blog and you want to learn a bit more about who I am and what I do!</p><p>I spend most of my time as an iOS developer for Student Beans and in my free time I love writing about software development, engineering and my experiences as a developer.</p><h3 id="who-am-i"><a href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3><p>I am an iOS developer working on frontend applications in a product-based environment. I have a background in Electronic Engineering and have a passion for software development, which has become my job over time.</p><p>My passion started on my last year of university, where I focused my dissertation on an augmented reality iOS synthesiser using ARKit.</p><blockquote><p>If you are interested, you can find the source code for my dissertation <a href="https://github.com/pol-piella/ARSynthesis">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Since then, I had it very clear that I wanted to become an iOS engineer so I found a job straight out of uni as an iOS developer in a music technology company and never looked back ðŸ’ª.</p><h4 id="my-carreer"><a href="#my-carreer" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My carreer</h4><p>I have 3 years experience as an iOS developer and so far I have worked within product-based teams and squads, closely working with Product Managers, designers and developers from multiple stacks. This has given me the opportunity to get a lot of context of how product lifecycles work and get a good grasp of how a large application is architected and scaled. These have been my roles so far:</p><ul><li><strong>_iOS developer at Student Beans (2020-present): _</strong>Working as an iOS developer within a big engineering team. Most of my days consist on building new features within our iOS application, A/B testing them, communicating with 3rd-party APIs and our own BE services using <code>GraphQL</code> and working together with designers, product managers and other developers to plan, refine and work on and maintain features.</li><li><strong>_iOS developer at Music Tribe (2018-2020): _</strong>Due to the project's requirements, spent most of time here working on a <code>React</code> application which was running on a <code>CEF</code> browser in a C++ application. This was quite challenging work but gave me a great deal of experience in web development and using <code>Docker</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>React</code>, <code>css</code>, <code>Node</code>, and many more.</li></ul><h4 id="my-projects"><a href="#my-projects" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My Projects</h4><p>While I spend most of my time working on feature work as a full-time developer at Student Beans, I love working on side-projects to expand my knowledge and stay on top of and trial new technologies and languages as they come out. You can check out some of my projects below and feel free to comment on them or suggest any changes that you would like to see on them:</p><ul><li>**Personal **<a href="https://github.com/pol-piella/portfolio-web"><strong>portfolio website</strong></a>: This is the site that hosts my personal blog (which you are currently reading ðŸ˜ƒ). It is a <code>React</code> application using <code>Ghost</code> as a hadless CMS to manage the blog's content and hosted on my own domain using <code>Netlify</code>.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pol-piella/pushy-cli">Pushy</a></strong>: A lightweight CLI tool written entirely in <code>Swift</code>, which can be used to generate <code>apns</code> files and send them directly to an app running on the booted simulator.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/pol-piella/js-snake"><strong>JS-Snake</strong></a>: A little snake game written in vanilla javascript, HTML and css.</li></ul><h3 id="what-to-expect-from-this-blog"><a href="#what-to-expect-from-this-blog" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What to expect from this blog?</h3><p>On this blog you can expect to read about software development and my own opinions and experiences from my career. I do also like to use blogging and articles as a way of learning and investigating new technologies and share my opinions on them with the rest of the community.</p><p><strong>_Happy Coding! _</strong></p></article></div><footer class="astro-n31rkg6Y"><div class="social astro-n31rkg6Y"><a class="animated astro-n31rkg6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pol-piella"><img width="25px" height="25px" src="/assets/github.svg" class="astro-n31rkg6Y"></a><a class="animated astro-n31rkg6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pol-piella-81b846115/"><img width="25px" height="25px" src="/assets/linkedin.svg" class="astro-n31rkg6Y"></a><a class="animated astro-n31rkg6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/polcodes"><img width="25px" height="25px" src="/assets/twitter.svg" class="astro-n31rkg6Y"></a></div></footer></body></html>
