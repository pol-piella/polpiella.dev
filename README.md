## Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal site, which you can find at: https://www.polpiella.codes

The site is written using `Next.js` and the content is managed using `Ghost` as a headless CMS. To deploy it, I use `Netlify`, which deploys the app on the `main` branch and gives you previews on PRs.
